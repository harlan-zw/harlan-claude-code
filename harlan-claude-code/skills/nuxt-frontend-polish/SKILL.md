# Nuxt UI Polish

Refine existing Nuxt UI interfaces by auditing against the project's own design system.

If `$ARGUMENTS` names a specific area, skip to that area's audit + reference.

## Step 0: Read the Foundation

Before touching anything, read the project's design system files:

```
Read: app/assets/css/main.css      → @theme tokens, --ui-* overrides, custom classes
Read: app.config.ts                → colors, component theme overrides, defaultVariants
Read: nuxt.config.ts               → fonts, colorMode, ui.theme.colors
```

This tells you what the project considers "correct." Every audit below is against **these files**, not generic best practices.

## Step 1: Audit Foundation Tokens

Check that the design system is complete — missing tokens cause inconsistency downstream.

| Token category | Where defined | What to check |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| Colors | `app.config.ts` `colors` | `primary` and `neutral` set? Additional theme colors registered in `nuxt.config.ts`? |
| Fonts | `@theme` `--font-*` | At least `--font-sans` defined? Display/mono if used? Registered in `nuxt.config.ts` `fonts.families`? |
| Semantic overrides | `:root` / `.dark` `--ui-*` | `--ui-bg`, `--ui-text`, `--ui-border` customized? Dark mode intentional or just inverted? `--ui-radius` set? |
| Component overrides | `app.config.ts` `ui.*` | Key components (card, button, modal, input) themed? `defaultVariants` set? |
| Unnecessary tokens | `@theme` | Custom `--shadow-*`, `--radius-*`, `--color-surface` etc. that duplicate Tailwind builtins (`shadow-md`, `rounded-xl`, `bg-default`)? Remove and use Tailwind/Nuxt UI equivalents. Only keep tokens truly unique to the design (glass effects, mesh gradients, etc.) |

**If tokens are missing**: fix them first — they cascade everywhere. Reference [design-system.md from nuxt-frontend-design-system](../nuxt-frontend-design-system/references/design-system.md) for setup patterns.

## Step 2: Audit Consistency

Scan `.vue` files for violations against the established tokens:

| Violation | Example | Fix |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| Hardcoded colors | `bg-slate-100`, `text-gray-900` | → `bg-muted`, `text-default` (Nuxt UI semantic tokens) |
| Tailwind shadows/radii used inconsistently | `shadow-lg` in one card, `shadow-md` in another | → pick one per component type, apply via `app.config.ts` |
| Banned fonts | Inter, Roboto, Arial, system-ui | → project's `--font-sans` / `--font-display` |
| Mixed spacing | Random `p-3`, `p-5`, `p-8` on same-level elements | → consistent rhythm |
| Inline styles | `style="background: #0a0a0a"` | → Tailwind class or semantic token |
| Raw HTML elements | `button`, `input`, `table` | → Nuxt UI components |

## Step 3: Elevate

Only after foundation and consistency are solid. Read references based on what the UI needs:

| Symptom | Reference |
|---------|-----------|
| Feels flat/static | [interactions.md](references/interactions.md) — hover, focus, loading, spring CSS |
| No entrance animations | [motion.md](references/motion.md) — motion-v, scroll reveals, stagger, transitions |
| Typography feels generic | [typography.md](references/typography.md) — font pairing, weight extremes, scale |
| Layout cramped or boring | [spatial.md](references/spatial.md) — whitespace, grids, layering, backgrounds |
| Colors dull or inconsistent | [color.md](references/color.md) — dominant+accent, dark mode, glows |

Read ALL references when asked to "make it better" or "polish everything".

## Rules

- **Keep what works** — don't change what's already distinctive
- **"Same product, elevated execution"** — not "This is different"
- **No wholesale replacement** when refinement would work
- **No scope creep** — polish what's there, don't add features
